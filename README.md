# Customer-Call-Analyzation

## Customer Call Analysis

This repository contains code for analyzing customer call data. It utilizes two different NLP (Natural Language Processing) libraries - WatsonX and Groq - to extract insights from call conversations.

### Running the code

To run the code, you'll need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can then execute the script using the following command:

```
python src/main.py
```

This script will process the customer call data and generate analytical reports.

### Dependencies

* WatsonX
* Groq

We leverage WatsonX and Groq for their capabilities in:

* Speech-to-text conversion
* Sentiment analysis
* Topic modeling
* Entity recognition

These functionalities allow us to gain a deeper understanding of customer conversations, identify patterns, and extract valuable insights to improve customer service experiences.

### Further Exploration

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different functionalities offered by WatsonX and Groq. The code is well-structured and documented, making it easy to understand and modify.

I hope this README provides a clear overview of the repository and its functionalities.
